**Context**  
This dataset is for those who are interested in dimensionality reduction techniques such as principle component analysis (PCA) or non-linear techniques like t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).  

**Content**  
This dataset contains single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) gene expression count data from a population of glioblastoma cells of a human male donor age 57. Glioblatoma is the most aggressive type of cancer which forms in the brain. It makes up around 15% of all brain cancer occurences in humans. Sympoms range from headache to those similar to a stroke and even unconsciousness. This dataset is freely available from 10X Genomics (downloaded on 26/11/2020). The data I uploaded here is already filtered for cells that appear to be healthy and alive, so you can have a go at the analysis without the hassle of going through the filtering steps. However, if you do want to filter the raw data yourself, this data is also available on the 10X Genomics download page.
